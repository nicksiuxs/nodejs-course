## Diferences between browser js and Node.js

- First node doesn't have access to the browser apis (DOM, geolocation, fetch, etc).
- With node we build server side apps (pure logic, no GUI).
- Access to the filesystem.
- Node apps depends only on node.js version it was built.
- Acces to modules by default.

## Global variables in Node (some variables)

- \_\_dirname : path to current directory
